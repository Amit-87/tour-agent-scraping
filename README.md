# tour-agent-scraping
In this project I scraped data of travel agents in Delhi with the help of Python and Selenium.
The data on the site was tracked with the help of xpath, class name and css selectors.
The scraped data is stored in MySQl table agent.sql which is then dumped into an excel file agent.xlsx.
